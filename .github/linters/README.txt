Custom rule files for Super-Linter are placed in this directory. For example,
to specify custom rules for pylint, add a file named .python-lint to this
directory.

If a different name for a rule file is specified in the environment variables
for a linter, e.g. PYTHON_PYLINT_CONFIG_FILE=.pylintrc, use that name instead.
