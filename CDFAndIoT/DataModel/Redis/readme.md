# Redis Data Model

This data model is intended to make it easier and safer to share Redis keys
and channels between different services. It provides utilities for formatting
and creating Redis keys in a predictable and programmatic way that eliminates
the need for copy-pasting and direct string manipulation.

## Installation

From root repo folder, else update the path to be this folder

```bash
pip install CDFAndIoT/DataModel/Redis
```

For local develop, include the `-e` flag to allow an editable install

## Usage

be found on confluence [here](https://gttwiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PD/pages/3191177295/Redis+Data+Model)
